          To get started, make an account and set up a profile. From there,
          connect with friends by making an event, or responding to a friends
          event and let them know you'll be going. If you have a suggestion to
          the events creator, post a comment and let them know your thoughts.
          You can even respond to comments on an event, and tell other people
          that you think their idea is stupid.
